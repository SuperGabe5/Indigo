# CeriumOS &nbsp; [![bluebuild build badge](https://github.com/blue-build/template/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/blue-build/template/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is my solution to fill in the gap that may be left by the death of ChromiumOS

## Installation

> [!WARNING]  
> THIS IS NOT BASED ON ChromiumOS, IT IS BASED ON FEDORA KINOITE

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/blue-build/template:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- You Can migrate from any rpm-ostree based system, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase -r ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/supergabe5/cerium:latest
  ```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/supergabe5/cerium
```
